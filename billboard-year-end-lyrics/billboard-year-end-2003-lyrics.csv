1,In da Club,50 Cent," 

Go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacard√≠ like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed

When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, then the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed, hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey, nigga, roll that weed up (Roll that)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A., they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)
Now shawty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow (Uh-huh)
Her girlfriend with her, they bi and they ready to go (Okay)

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Rubbed)

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryna pull me back, right?
When my joint get to bumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me, ""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let 'em hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Hahahaha)

Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither, nigga
We in the club all the time, nigga, so pop, pop off, nigga

When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand

You crazy? Bring your whole set (Oh)
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?""

5,When I'm Gone,3 Doors Down,"
There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
But somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well maybe it's too far away, yeah
Or maybe I'm just blind
Or maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

When your education x-ray
Cannot see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing
That I could not tell my friends
Roaming through this darkness
I'm alive, but I'm alone
And part of me is fighting this
But part of me is gone

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone
Or maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

Love me when I'm gone
When I'm gone
When I'm gone
When I'm gone "
6,Unwell,Matchbox Twenty," 
All day
Starin' at the ceilin', makin'
Friends with shadows on my wall
All night
Hearin' voices tellin' me
That I should get some sleep
Because tomorrow might be good for somethin'

Hold on
Feelin' like I'm headed for a
Breakdown
And I don't know why

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

Me
I'm talkin' to myself in public
And dodgin' glances on the train
And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be somethin' wrong

With me
Out of all the hours thinkin'
Somehow
I've lost my mind

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

I've been talkin' in my sleep
Pretty soon they'll come to get me
Yeah, they're takin' me away

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be
Hey, how I used to be
How I used to be
Well, I'm just a little unwell
How I used to be
How I used to be
I'm just a little unwell "

9,Picture,Kid Rock," 
Livin' my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her (Ooh-ooh)

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows, but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waitin' on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him (Ooh)
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him (Ooh)

I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same, how have you been?
Since you've been gone, my world's been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were comin' home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away (Drink you away)
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home (Ooh-ooh)
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home

I just called to say I love you
Come back home

How can you see into my eyes
Like open doors?
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb

Without a soul (Soul)
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me (Ooh, oh)
Breathe into me and make me real (Make me real)
Bring (Bring) me (Me) to life

Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
I've been livin' a lie
There's nothing inside
Bring me to life

Frozen inside (Frozen inside)
Without your touch (Without your love)
Without your love, darling
Only you (Only you) are the life (Life) among the dead
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
I've been living a lie (Bring me to life)
There's nothing inside (There's nothing inside)

Your body is banging mama, but where your brains at?

We been together for a few years (Tell 'em), shed a few tears (Mmhm)
Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Pooh Bear
I'm always on the road (Chyeah), hardly ever home (Huh?)
Always busy this, busy that, can't talk on the phone
I know you aggravated (Huh), walk around frustrated
Patience gettin' short (Huh, huh), how longer can you tolerate it? (Come on, what?)
Listen, Ma, I'm just motivated
I do this for us, stuck on the grind, tryin' to elevate it now

Ayo, to really be honest you stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express through words how much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man never above you
Well, I could tell that you different from most, slightly approach you
And the ill shit about it? We don't sex every day (Ahhh)
But when we sex, we tease in a passionate way (Ooh, ooh)

I love the way we sleep and how we always cuddle in bed (Uh, eh)
Baby, I stay embracin' your patience, sheddin' your tears with me (Uh)
I ask you, my Mami, please continue to bear with me (Yeah-ooh)
We started out broke, constantly on the roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old (Mhm-mhm)
Went from loosies and buses, and fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed, still got each other back (Yeah-eh, yeah)
Word is bond, never screwed none of these industry cats, boy
We like Scull and Mulder, walkin' shoulder to shoulder (Yeah)
Milkin' this game, watchin' our seeds gettin' older (Yeah)

Until our love will touch the sky (Uh)
So, baby, come and get more close to me (Mariah)
'Cause this is where your love is supposed to beee, eh-eh-eh (Tell 'em)
I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA (Huh), you haven't seen me
You lookin' good in that Gucci bikini (Aaah, ah-ooh)
38 carats, your ring lookin' freezy (Mmhm, yeah)
No matter what I do in the world, you never leave me
Fall back, Ma, I'll make your lifestyle easy (Yeah)

18,I'm with You,Avril Lavigne,"
I'm standin' on the bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening, but there's no sound

Isn't anyone tryna find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

It's a damn cold night
Tryna figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you, mmm

I'm lookin' for a place
I'm searchin' for a face
Is anybody here? I know
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone

Isn't anyone tryna find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

It's a damn cold night
Tryna figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?

19,Drift Away,Uncle Kracker," 
Day after day, I'm more confused
Yet, I look for the light through the pourin' rain
You know that's a game that I'd hate to lose
And I'm feelin' the strain
Oh, ain't it a shame?

Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Won't you take me away?

Beginnin' to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
And I'm countin' on you
You can carry me through

Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Won't you take me away?

And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
When I'm feelin' blue
The guitars come in through to soothe me

Thanks for the joy that you've given me
(Ooh, the joy that you've given me)
I want you to know that I believe in your song (Oh, yeah)
Your rhythm, and rhyme, and harmony (Mmmhmm)
You helped me along (Makin' me strong)
Oh, you're makin' me strong

Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul

23,Into You,Fabolous," 
Baby girl (I really like)
Desert Storm (yeah)

I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now, I want to be more than a friend of you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the '90s into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
'Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vows
Maybe, I'm speakin' general now
But girl I'ma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On Fifth Ave. shoppin' sprees, and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous, it's the principle now
I'm so into you

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

Come on ma, it's more than a flashin'
I woulda traded it all, in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashin'
Just off the shore, so you can hear when the water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks you be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin'
Would have me with the blue's so hard, you would think I was Crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxin' when you spend
Ever since you've been askin' 'bout the friends
How'd you like it if, both our name's had Jackson on the ends, uh

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becomin' too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Bart, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah

I really like what you've done to me

Uh, uh, uh

Baby girl, you know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect you, gangsta
Treat you like a princess and put some on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin' lineup ain't playin' right
I come off the bench wit' her
It might sound like I'm gassin' ya
But it take time to get from the backseat to the passenger
We been creepin' and sneakin' just to keep it from leakin'
We so deep in our freakin' that we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey's a little bit uptight
Wonder why I keep coming home in the middle of the night

To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket (Oh)
You gon' play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry 'bout you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin' I denied
Somethin' I would slide just to do somethin' in the ride
But shorty, there's somethin' you provide
'Cause the entr√©e ain't as good (Mmm)
Without somethin' on the side, you know?

I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)

Uh-oh, I might be leavin' the earth soon
My girl gon' kill me if she smell the scent of your perfume
It's gon' be a clip tossed if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me wit' a empty Magnum wrapper (Ooh, yeah)
So keep it on the down low, call the car celly (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You seen what happened with Mr. Bigg and R Kelly, uh

And I can't deny I (Love it when I'm witchu, baby)

I got a fetish for fuckin' you witcha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin' so long? I'm gettin' anxious
But patiently waitin' for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent
'Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin'
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me lickin' at me
'Cause every woman just wanna be happy

Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen
I'm the only piece of the puzzle you're missin
Like when we kissin' - bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll - ride ride ride
So take me, tonight
And do what you do to me, baby

Girl, your stare, those eyes, I (Love it when you look at me, baby)
Your lips, your smile, I (Love it when you kiss me, baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (Love it when you thug me, baby)
And I can't deny I (Love it when I'm witchu, baby)
Shorty, are you really gettin' bored with me, or him?
'Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
But then again I'm still young and I'm livin' my life
You know you're right and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your number
Baby, I can only help but wonder
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)
Ah-ah-ah
You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thang
It's a man's world, but I understand
But there's still nothin' different, boy, stick to the plan
You be my down ass, witcha round ass

26,Where Is the Love?,Black Eyed Peas,"
What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

Now sing with me, y'all (One world, one world)
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the w-world, world, yeah
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world) "
27,The Game of Love,Santana," 
Tell me
Just what you want me to be
One kiss
And boom, you're the only one for me

So please tell me why
Don't you come around no more?
'Cause right now I'm cryin'
Outside the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love

It's whatever you make it to be
Sunshine instead of this cold lonely sea
So, please, baby, try
And use me for what I'm good for
It ain't saying goodbye
It's knocking down the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love

You roll me, control me, console me
Please hold me
You guide me, divide me into one
Ooh


So please tell me why
Don't you come around no more?
'Cause right now I'm dying
Outside the door of your loving store

It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love
(A little bit of this, a little bit of that)
It's all in this game of love
It's all in the game of love
(A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain)
Let's play the game of love
Roll me, control me, please hold me
(A little bit of this, a little bit of that)
Make me feel good, yeah
(A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain)
Now here on my own, on my own
(A little bit of this, a little bit of that)

28,Lose Yourself,Eminem," 
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

31,How You Gonna Act Like That,Tyrese," 
It seems like just the other day that we hooked up
(I was drivin', you was walkin' and I swooped you up)
From that moment on I knew you were the one, yeah
(I was single, you was lonely and we fell in love)
We would sit and talk for hours about anything
(Baby, you hang up, no, you hang up, on three hang up)
I bought your whip, I paid your rent, I gave you everything
(Said you'd always be my baby then you bounced)
How you gonna?

How you gonna up and leave me now?
How you gonna act like that?
How you gonna change it up, we just finished makin' up?
How you gonna act like that?
How you gonna act like we don't be makin' love
You know we be tearin' it up, breakin' stuff, that ghetto love
How you gonna trip, how could you forget
How you gonna act like that

Girl, I never thought that lovin' you would hurt
(I did everything a good man would to make it work)
Girl, you should have told me you had second thoughts
(Like before I put the down on the house we bought)
Now I'm thinkin' you and me was a mistake
(But then it hits me and I'm missin' all the love we made)
Girl, I know that we've been goin' through some things, yeah
(But the sun is somewhere shinin' even when it rains, oh)

I'll be the one you kick it to
I'll be the one that misses you
I'll be the one to ease your pain
I'll be the one you won't forget
And you'll be the one I can't forget
You'll be the one that's Heaven sent
You'll be the one I can't deny
You'll be the one that makes me cry, baby

How you gonna up and leave me now? (Why you do)
How you gonna act like that? (Why you gotta act like this?)
How you gonna change it up? (Whoa, ho, baby) We just
Finished makin' up

Just to keep you in my heart (Keep you in my heart)
I messed around and gave up everything

35,Landslide,Dixie Chicks," 
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well

Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills

40,Air Force Ones,Nelly," 
Big boy

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' about 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I damn near shot 'em

Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; may niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

Don't get me wrong, man
Now Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin' there as if I'm shootin' free throws
I said, ""Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you Murph, especially in the white 'n blue""
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice""
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), ""Thanks for the advice""

I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops, which the clear sole
But it's Timb's and fat laces when it's cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit' them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho'
On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""
O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and put wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin' in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin' dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, they know I'm buyin' dem

Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin' them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose, ya heard me, kinda like my Daytons

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones
I wore spurs at first now there's tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them

Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind, no one gave a shit
Knowin' he could rap, no one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
Fifty thousand sold, seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone, three years later
Stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smellin' like Burberry cologne
Still ridin' chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen, never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect, you'll give me
Ludacris, I live loud like Timmay (Uh)
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache, and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head tucked tight
Sprayed, so I never let the bedbugs bite
Hard to the core, core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton

Miss independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance, mmm
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne

So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said, ooh, she fell in love

What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

Misguided heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love

So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love

What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Open this door)
Surprise, it's time (Yeah)
To feel what's real, what's real
What happened to Miss Independent? (Oh)
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you (Old you)
When love, when love is true

When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of ""Why can't that be me?""
I'm so glad I finally see
What is this feelin' taking over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Oh yeah)
Surprise (Surprise), it's time (Yeah)
To feel (To feel) what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive (Yeah)
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you
When love, when love is true

45,Calling All Angels,Train," 
I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
When there is no place safe
And no safe place to put my head
When you can feel the world shake
From the words that are said

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up

I need a sign to let me know you're here
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear
I want a reason for the way things have to be
I need a hand to help build up
Some kind of hope inside of me

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

When children have to play inside
So they don't disappear
While private eyes solve marriage lies
'Cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing queens (I won't give up if you don't give up)
And losing sight of having dreams
In a world that what we want (I won't give up if you don't give up)
Is only what we want until it's ours

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

And I'm calling all angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
And I'm calling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)

When the world wasn't upside down
I could take all the time I had
But I'm not gonna wait when a moment can vanish so fast
'Cause every kiss is a kiss you can never get back

Lift me up in your eyes
If you told me that is what heaven is
Well, you'd be right
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

When the answer to all my dreams
Is as close as a touch away
Why am I here holding back what I'm trying to say?

Lift me up in your eyes
If you told me that is what heaven is
Well, you'd be right
Hold me close to your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

This is the night where we capture forever
And all our tomorrows begin
After tonight, we will never be lonely again

Lift me up in your eyes
If you told me that is what heaven is
Well, you'd be right
Hold me close to your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this

Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets

Blaow! We ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance
Like this

When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back

Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back

Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!

Damn right, the fire marshal wanna shut us down
Get us out, so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting some cut up
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over; Luda got something to say
Do it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today
Work with me, let's become one with the beat
And don't worry about me stepping all over your feet
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back

Stand up!

52,The Remedy I Won't Worry,Jason Mraz,"
Well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
Well, something on the surface, it stings
I said, something on the surface, well, it kinda makes me nervous
Who says that you deserve this?
And what kind of god would serve this?
We will cure this dirty old disease
Well, if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says, the comedy is that it's serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh

Well, I heard two men talking on the radio
In a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
While they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophe
Dance with me, 'cause if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I (I won't, I won't, I won't)
I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh

When I fall in love (I fall in love), I take my time
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun (Turn off the sun), but I'm still gonna shine
And then I'll tell you why
Because the remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

I ('Cause I won't)
I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I (I won't, I won't, I won't)
I won't worry my life away
(I won't worry my life)
I (I won't)
I won't worry my life away, no
('Cause I won't, and I won't, and I won't) I
Won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh

53,Why Don't You & I,Santana,"
Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking 'round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

But every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say, ""Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again""
So I say, ""Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in""

When's this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say, ""Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again""
So I say, ""Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in""

Slowly, I begin to realize, this is never gonna end
Right about the same time you walk by
And I say, ""Oh, here we go again, oh""

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say, ""Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again""
So I say, ""Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?

He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!
Said 'scuse me, damn!
You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one
You're so contagious, I can't take it

Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one
You can easily get past, but that chapter is done

Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role
I'm 'bout to give you all the keys and security codes
'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin'
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?

58,I Can,Nas," 
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen""
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete

Like no one else

You're something else

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely

And so many moons that we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better, better, better

For real
'Cause underneat' it all, you are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire, you were always burnin'
Anytime you're around, my body keeps callin'
For your touch, your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's another side of you, weh this a woman yah adore
Aside from your temper, everything else secure
You're good for me, baby, for that, I'm sure
'Cause over and over again, me want more
You've used up all your coupons
And all you got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely
You're really lovely

60,If You're Not the One,Daniel Bedingfield,"
If you're not the one, then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one, then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine, then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine, would I have the strength to stand at all?

I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?

If I don't need you, then why am I cryin' on my bed?
If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me, then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife?

I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I'm praying you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life

I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?

'Cause I miss you
Body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you
Into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you
Whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side

I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms? "

Sliding down the pole
Horny but fo sho'
Both our hands we're up
Drinks was in the cup
She showed me some love
So we left the club
Now we up in the Hummer V
She's so hot she's kissing on me
This is the girl of my fantasy
After the Remy we were doing our thing

I had her singing

Nice honies while I'm chillin' by the pool (ah)
Red bikinis with some pump heel shoes (ah)
Who could think of any damn thing cooler
We at the crib so it ain't no rules (ah)
I'm butt naked, sweat socks, and house shoes (ah)
100 bottles of cris in the cool (ah)
I'm frozen thanks the Jacob the Jeweler
One day without me and she's shaking like a fiend (ah)
Y'all tell me what's r&b without the R (ah)

She had hazel eyes said she's from Africa
She broke it down right in front of me
Moaning on her knees I said I'm scared of ya
Tattoo on her back lovin' the way she work it
Body movin' like she's dancin' in a circus
Back forth up down when she jerk it

62,Here Without You,3 Doors Down," 
A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah

The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go
Oh yeah, yeah

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby

Everything I know, and anywhere I go (Yeah)
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And when the last one falls (Whoa)
When it's all said and done
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby

By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
When you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they gon' murk 50, how?

65,It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,Alan Jackson,"
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow
An' so am I
Work day passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July
I'm gettin' paid by the hour, an' older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him somethin'
I think I'll just call it a day

Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

Oh, this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
An' half the night
Tomorrow mornin', I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's alright
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
Our Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone‚Äôs for me
You can tell 'em I just sailed away

And pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab
An' be back to work before two
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do?
Funny you should ask Alan, I'd say:
""Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care""
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
He don't care
And I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

What time zone am I on? What country am I in?
It doesn't matter, it's five o'clock somewhere
It's always on five in Margaritaville, come to think of it
Yeah, I heard that
You been, there haven't you?
Yessir
I seen your boat there
I've been to Margaritaville a few times
Alright, that's good
Stumbled all the way back
Okay, just wanna make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons
Ha ha ha ha, between the buoys, I tell you
Alright. Well, it's five o'clock. Let's go somewhere

67,Can't Hold Us Down,Christina Aguilera," 
Mm

So, what, am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Whoa)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (Whoa)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder!
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud (Whoa)
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody gonna hold us down (Hold us down)
Never can, never will

So, what, am I not 'sposed to say what I'm sayin'?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world) (Yeah)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Respect your worth)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
(You can't get rid of us)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder!
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
(We standin' our ground on this one)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down (Check it)
Here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's alright though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back

You're just a little boy, you think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
Said you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
This is for my girls!

This is for my girls all around the world, oh
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth
(Respect your worth, oh)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder! (Shout louder!)

68,My Front Porch Looking In,Lonestar," 
Ooh, yeah
Woo, yeah
Yeah oh yeah

The only ground I ever owned was stickin' to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch at this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up with rays of golden sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences like that's where it was hung

My blessings aren't in front of me
It's not about the land
I'll never beat the view
Of my front porch looking in

There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

I've traveled here and everywhere following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home to the one He made for me

'Cause anywhere I'll ever go
And everywhere I've been
Nothing takes my breath away
Like my front porch looking in

There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

I've seen what beautiful is about
When I'm looking in
Not when I'm looking out
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Oh, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in, yeah
Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk

A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong, yeah
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them, oh, yeah

69,Angel,Amanda Perez," 
It's been five months since you went away
You left without a word and nothing to say (Nothing to say)
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you, no
So I asked God

God send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
'Cause all I do is cry (Is cry)
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

And I know it might sound crazy
But after all that, I still love you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there's something I have to do
I have to tell the one that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more
'Cause my heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries
So, God

God send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
'Cause all I do is cry (All I do is cry)
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
(Send me an angel)

Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please to send you back to me
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep
You made me feel like I could not breathe
Now all I wanted to do was to feel your touch
And give you all my love (give you all my love)
But you took my love for granted
Want my lovin' now, but you can't have it
So, God

God send me an angel (Send me an angel)
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes
Oh God, send me (God send me an angel)
An angel (Wipe the tears from my eyes)
Oh baby
Send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel (God send me an angel)
From being in love (Send me an angel)
Oh God, send me an angel
Send me an angel (Send me an angel)

70,She Hates Me,Puddle of Mudd," 
Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
No feeling of bad, no

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

That's my story, as you see
Learned my lesson and so did she
Now it's over and I'm glad
Cause I'm a fool for all I've said

She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away
La la la la la la la la la love
Trust

71,Don't Wanna Try,Frankie J,"
I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
They hurt so bad that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it, four years go down the drain
Oh, how I wish things would have happened so differently
I tried to save us so many times, but still, you couldn't see
You kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again

And now you're tryna tell me that you're sorry
And you're tryna come back home
You're tellin' me you really need me crying
Beggin' both knees are on the floor
But baby, I

Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
And say the things that hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, I've about just had enough
It's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love

You and I had many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
But all of that just seems so far away from me
Had to wake up, face reality
It all just seem too good to be true after all you put me through

And now you're tryna tell me that you're sorry
And you're tryna come back home
You're tellin' me you really need me crying
Beggin' both knees are on the floor
But baby, I

Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
And say the things that hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, I've about just had enough
It's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love


Don't wanna try, don't wanna try
Don't wanna try no more
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, oh
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try
Don't wanna try no more
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more

Somebody stole a car
Somebody got away
Somebody didn‚Äôt get too far, yeah
They didn‚Äôt get too far

Grand pappy told my pappy, back in my day, son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas, find a tall oak tree
Round up all of them bad boys hang them high in the street
For all the people to see

That justice is the one thing you should always find
You gotta saddle up your boys
You gotta draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singin' whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
We've got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets
It‚Äôs time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
Send them all to their maker and he'll settle them down
You can bet he'll set them down 'cause

Justice is the one thing you should always find
You gotta saddle up your boys
You gotta draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
We'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces

Just bring the liquor, there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way, let me stop by the store
Get a 12-pack of Coronas - plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Rd
I'm already blowed, hit third I'mma be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet looking like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
It's three girls on the elevator like: ""wassup?""
I told em: ""follow me"". they knew I had it cracking B
One said ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped with much ding-a-ling""
Knock on the door, I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face
Fuck it then, feel like my head is toxic waste
It's some pretty girls in hurr, I heard em whispering
Talking bout ""that's that dude that sing ""Right Thurr"" - he glistening""
I ain't come to talk, I ain't come to sit

Man know what, get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, acting silly
The girl said ""can I be in yo video"" I'm like ""yeah!"", ""oh really?""
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wilding
Sharing the next room with some girls looking like they from an island

Just play a little ""D"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not Wiffle
Hit 'em in triples, with no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, with a ghetto tempo

Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice

After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you (Ooh)
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well, I, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, ohh

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game
I heard you're goin' 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hold me
But that won't work anymore (No more, a-ha, it's over)
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (Yeah)
It makes me that much wiser (Oh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)
Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Makes me that much smarter (Yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Fighter)
You thought I would forget, but I, I remembered (Ooh)
'Cause I remembered (Ooh)
I remembered
You thought I would forget (Ooh-ooh)
I remembered (Oh-ooh)
'Cause I remembered (Oh)
I remembered

Makes me that much stronger (Ooh-ooh)
Makes me work a little bit harder (Ooh-ooh)
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter "

83,Rain on Me,Ashanti," 
(Drum)
(Gong)
Hahaha!

I'm looking in the mirror at this woman, down and out
She's internally dying and knew this was not what love's about
I don't wanna be this woman the second time around
'Cause I'm waking up, screaming, no longer believing that I'm gonna be around
And over and over I tried, yet over and over, you lied
And over and over I cried, I don't know why
And over and over I tried, yet over and over, you lied
Over and over I cried, I don't know why

Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
Baby, just rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe, babe

See, I don't wanna hug my pillow late at night no more
I'm tossing and turning and thinking 'bout burning down these walls
I don't wanna fuel this fire no more, no more, no more
See, I made up my mind 'cause I've wasted my time
Ain't nothing here to keep me warm

And over and over I tried, yet over and over, you lied
And over and over I cried, I don't know why
And over and over I tried, yet over and over, you lied
Over and over I cried, I cried, I cried, I cried

Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
Baby, just rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe, babe

I'm so tired of the rain in my life
And I'm so tired of the strain and now you're gonna lie
'Cause sometimes, I can't sleep at night and
This here, it just don't seem right and
Sometimes, I just wonder why I
Almost let my life go by
Sometimes, I can't sleep at night and
This here, it just don't seem right and
Sometimes, I just wonder why I
Almost let my life go by
Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
Baby, just rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
Said I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live
Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
Baby, just rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
And I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live "
84,19 Somethin',Mark Wills,"
Woo
Oh yeah

I saw Star Wars at least eight times
Had the Pac-Man pattern memorized
And I've seen the stuff they put inside
Stretch Armstrong, yeah
Oh, I was Roger Staubach in my backyard
Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evel Knievel scars on my arm
Well, I was a kid when Elvis died
And my mama cried

It was 1970-something
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Fawcett hair-do days
Bell-bottoms and eight-track tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh, man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh, it was 1970-something, yeah

It was the dawning of a new decade
We got our first microwave
And Dad broke down and finally shaved them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubik's Cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
My first love was Daisy Duke in them cut-off jeans
A space shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried

It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
And lookin' back now I can see me
And oh, man, did I look cheesy
I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh, it was 1980-something

Now I got a mortgage and an SUV
But all this responsibility
Makes me wish (Wish) sometimes (Sometimes)

It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
And lookin' back now I can see me
And oh, man, did I look cheesy
I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh, it was 1980-something

1970-something
Aw, it was 19-something "
85,Can't Stop, Won't Stop," 
Can't stop, won't stop, get guap
Ten white toes in them Tory flip-flops
Manicures and pedicures, I'm always tip-top
When they say I'm not hot, all these lies need to stop
'Cause I'm icy, wifey, haters wanna fight me
Never been the one get RIP up on a white tee
Keep my hands clean, got some hittas moving sheisty
Ask me if I'm rollin' with some Gucci, bitch I might be
It's very unlikely my wrist ain't looking icy
Charging by the minute 'cause my time is very pricey

Yeah, I be where the bosses be
Judging from my vibe, you can feel it in my energy
Stacking paper steadily so I can live in luxury
Looking in the mirror, I thank God for what I'm 'bout to be
You beefing with my enemy does not make you a friend of me
Girls so weird, stay clear, I'm living drama free
Never living comfortably, got a lot of goals to meet
My team is trying to eat so we grinding 'til our mental bleed
You tryna get a bag of weed? I'm tryna get a bag a week
Put it in my savings and invest in the right companies
My dream is like a child and I'm taking all the custody
Obstacles be slowing me, but that buffer molded me
So I take my time, 'cause I'm always where I'm supposed to be
Keep my niggas close to me 'cause I'm knowing they go for me
You can not get a hold of me? I'm probably in a solo meet
Always making moves, man that's how I keep my sanity
Yeah, it's my team's summer
Couple setbacks, bounce back and recover
The clique real small but we making big moves
And we headed to the top so we can get a better view like
I'ma catch a tan overseas while I'm out the country
Let me get some Hennessy while I'm chilling on the beach
I'ma count a couple G's, let the server bring receipts
Double checking my expenses, never messy, always neat
Never ever, that's how a hot girl do it
Number one stunner, icy girl with a Cuban
Cash money, mama that be dining in Bahamas
Eating Fettucini pasta with the scallops and the lobsters
Huh, I don't got no time for these hoes
Speaking on my name like I'm someone that they know
I'm the big cat bitch, yes these niggas love me
Is that Gucci on my feet? Shit, bitch it might be "
86,Red Dirt Road,Brooks & Dunn," 
I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to Heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends of that red dirt road

Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to Heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends of that red dirt road

I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
Feels like I've found a long lost friend

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to Heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends of that red dirt road
Yes, I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends of that red dirt road "
87,What Was I Thinkin',Dierks Bentley,"
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

When a mountain of a man with a ""born to kill"" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-sliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking?
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking, oh what was I thinking, oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking "
88,Flying Without Wings,Ruben Studdard," 
Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the faces of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you find that special thing
You're flying without wings

Some find it sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

You'll find it in the deepest friendships
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

So impossible as they may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
'Cause who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete

But for me, it's waking up beside you, yeah
To watch the sun rise on your face
To know that I can say ""I love you""
At any given time or place, oh

It's the little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you mine, all mine
And it's the flying without wings
'Cause you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings

You're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy it brings
I'm flying without wings (Mm)"
89,Sing for the Moment,Eminem,"
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‚Äòcause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‚Äòcause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‚Äòcause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, so we can‚Äî
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away "
90,Have You Forgotten?,Darryl Worley," I hear people sayin'. We don't need this war
But I say there's some things worth fightin' for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
We didn't get to keep em' by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're gettin in
Before you start your preachin' let me ask you this my friend
Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And you say we shouldn't worry about Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbin for you and me
It'll just breed anger is what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's just out lookin' for a fight
Well after 9-11 man I'd have to say that's right
Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And we vow to get the ones behind Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
I'v been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember just what they're fighting for
Have you forgotten
All the people killed
Yes some went down like heroes
In that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten
About our Pentagon
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry 'bout Bin Laden

91,No Shoes No Shirt No Problems,Kenny Chesney," 
I've been up to my neck workin 6 days a week
wearin holes into the shoes on my feet
been dreamin of gettin away since i dont know
Aint no better time than now..for mexico

No shoes, No shirt, No problems
Blues what blues..hey i forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom 
and no shirt, no shirt, and no problems!
No problems 

Want a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea
want to look thru my shades and see you there with me
Want to soak up life for a while
In laid back mode
No boss, no polite, no stress, no dress code

No shoes, no shirt, no problems 
Blues what blues hey i forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
and no shoes, no shirt, and no problems

Babe lets get packed..tank tops and flip flops if u got them
No shoes, no shirt, no problems
No problems."

93,Sick of Being Lonely,Field Mob," 
Little shawty, we used to be on the phone all day
Talkin' to the sunshine shinin' on my bald head
Now today seem strange
No call on my celly, no name on my caller ID
Callin' you up and ya OGs sayin' you ain't home
What's really goin' on? I wanna know
So gimme a call and let's play no games
I'm playin', you want the plane
Don't point a finger over herre
I bought you a fur coat for your birthday
And this the things I get shorty?
Over there you starin' mad
That I went out with them other chicks
I told you they ain't shit!
They were just some buddies from high school that I went to
Where my old homies wanted me to kick it to 'em
But I called you up but you wasn't home
Baby girl when you get this message, gimme a call
I'll be waitin' at home

I'm so sick of being lonely
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I wanna know how it feels to be loved, be loved
Sick of being lonely
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I wanna know how it feels to be loved, be loved

Any other night, you'd be at home waitin' on me, yeah
(What's goin' on?)
Any other night, you'd be actin' like a bugaboo, ooh
(What's goin' on?)
Any other night, you'd be callin' me, stallin' me, ha
(What's goin' on?)
Any other night, I can guarantee a page from you, ooh
(What's goin' on?)

Hmmm, but tonight seem different
Man, it's about this fishy (I'm so confused)
Cuz I ain't even get shhhh
My wife ain't hit me on my pager or cell
And when I CALL HER, I keep gettin' the damn voice mail
What's goin' on? Yeah I know I'm wrong
For goin' and comin' home at 'bout four in the mornin'
Hopin' ya ""Home Alone"" like Caulkin
But I picked the wrong time, and respect will be expected


I'm so sick of bein' lon-
AHH, don't finish yo statement
You alone call me, I'll be yo replacement
Put me in the game coach, you can let that lame go
Let me lick you on your neck and go down to yo ankles
Cuz ain't no mo' better, freakier feller
From the Field to creep wit', when ya guys are dummy
Honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a late of neck bones
Tenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me
Cuz I be goin' and goin', rowin'
With mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'
Hit it huffin' and puffin', breath stankin' and yawnin'
Something so pretty as you at home alone
That's unbelieveable, like when the cow jumped over the moon
Now, I never put nothin' before you
That's like eatin' cereal, pickin' a fork over a spoon

What did I
Do to deserve such a man so special in my life?
So many days and nights
I get on the go while I sit and wait for mister right
Baby, then came you
Laidback with your sexy smile
When you move your body you just drive me wild
If you're feelin' me, baby, tell me now
Because I want you, I want you

Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do
I'm feelin' love in the deepest fall, give you the keys and all
You even when helped me when the beef was on
Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feelin' something real
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

Can't you see
How this love affair would be good for you and me?
'Cause baby, I swear no other man can do
The things that you do when you love me

Girl, I want you, girl, I need you
Slow down, love
Don't you see me with my girl, what you thinkin' it was
I know you're used to seein' me in the clubs
Different chicks, sippin' Cris', just a million in dubs
But I've changed, only got eyes for her
Believe me, ain't no girl dividin' us
We could maybe elope, have a baby and all
'Cause I don't wanna be a player no more

Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do

96,Like a Stone,Audioslave," 
On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we wanna go

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone


And on, I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone "
97,Don't Know Why,Norah Jones,"
I waited 'til I saw the sun
I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever
Out across the endless sea
I will die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever


Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum

I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come "
98,Superman,Eminem,"
You high, baby?

Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday (Yeah-yeah)
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

Love that tattoo, what's that say?
""Rot In Pieces,"" uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial

I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax

Can be a real good man
