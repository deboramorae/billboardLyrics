1,Shape of You,Ed Sheeran," 
A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

2,Despacito Remix,Luis Fonsi Daddy Yankee,"

Comin' over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh, yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, ""¡Ay, bendito!""
I can move forever cuando esté contigo
¡Báilalo!
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (DY)
Despacito "

And I'm gonna give it to you

Gold jewelry shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice

I promise that your smile ain't gon' ever leave
Shoppin' sprees in Paris

Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me, who's the fairest?
Is it you? (Is it you?) Is it me? (Is it me?)
Say it's us (Say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

If you want it, girl, come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me, baby, tell me, tell me, baby
What you tryna do?

Gold jewelry shinin' so bright

Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still I take you down right on your mama couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy

Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

5,Something Just Like This,The Chainsmokers Coldplay," 
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, ""Where d'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk?""
I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, ""Whered 'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk?""
I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can miss

I want something just like this
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this

Where d'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this "

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever gettin' older

We ain't ever gettin' older
We ain't ever gettin' older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever gettin' older

We ain't ever gettin' older

8,Body Like a Back Road,Sam Hunt," 
Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can (Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed)
Got braids in her hair (I know every curve like the back of my hand) "

First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail
I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up

11,Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,"
I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go "

New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table

There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes

15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater

Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn, this nigga lame"" to remember my name

They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth

And I could leave you just as fast

But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me

Bask in the glory of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need ya

You do shit on purpose
You get mad and you break things
Feel bad, try to fix things
But you're perfect, poorly wired circuit
And got hands like an ocean
Push you out, pull you back in

'Cause you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause you see it from the same point of view

'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me, and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need ya

30,Scars to Your Beautiful,Alessia Cara," 
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurtin', let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful "

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore "

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

You (You) asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)

Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

40,Castle on the Hill,Ed Sheeran," 
When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill "

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me like novacaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
Cause we're just living
Between the sheets
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated "

To get away from your parents

Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Postin' pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace

On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Gettin' drunk on the past we were livin' in

Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
Or we could wait until the walls come down

But, oh, until it falls, won't bother me

Is it coming?

49,Can't Stop the Feeling!,Justin Timberlake,"
I got this feelin' inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket, got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (Ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)

Nothin' I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'

I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's somethin' magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushin' on (Rushin' on)
I don't need no reason, don't need control (Need control)
I fly so high, no ceilin', when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket, got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (Ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a ""Yes, sir,"" not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say: ""You're basic,"", they say: ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Thunder, thunder

Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people
That they loved one day, locked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never know  the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You'll never know the freak show sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think ""How did I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it, watch it)

All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know (Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed (It's blasphemy)
I tried to warn you just to stay away (Wouldn't listen to me)
And now they're outside ready to bust (And guess what?)
It looks like you might be one of us "

Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
Five, four, three, two, one
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze

Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, ""Okay you're special""
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami
In the middle of the party, bitch, get off me (off me)

Hadn't had a good time since you know when
Got talked into goin' out with hopes you were stayin' in
I was feelin' like myself for the first time in a long time
Until I bumped into some of your friends over there talkin' to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightnin'
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talkin' 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

A Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane

89,Malibu,Miley Cyrus," 
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu (Baby)
Next to you (Oh, oh)

We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start, a dream come true in Malibu "

100,The Fighter,Keith Urban," 
I know he hurt you
Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you
'Cause your precious heart is a precious heart
He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh, oh, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you

What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter

Look in the mirror
You're beautiful, so beautiful
I'm here to remind you
You're my only one, let me be the one
To heal all the pain that he put you through
It's a love like you never knew
Just let me show you

What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise, I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter

I wanna believe that you got me, baby
I swear I do from now until the next life
I wanna love, wanna give you all my heart

What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
What if I cry?
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter "
