1,Tik Tok,Kesha," 
Wake up in the morning feelin' like P. Diddy (Hey, what up, girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes, tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs, pullin' up to the parties
Tryna get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, woah, oh, oh, woah, woah, oh
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, woah, oh, oh, woah, woah, oh

Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are linin' up, 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talkin' 'bout everybody gettin' crunk, crunk, boys try to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he gettin' too drunk, drunk
No-now we go until they kick us out, out or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down, po-po shut us down

Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, woah, oh, oh, woah, woah, oh
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, woah, oh, oh, woah, woah, oh

(DJ) You build me up, you break me down
My heart, it pounds, yeah, you got me
With my hands up, you got me now
You got that sound, yeah, you got me
(DJ) You build me up, you break me down
My heart, it pounds, yeah, you got me
With my hands up, put your hands up
Put your hands up
Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in

Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, woah, oh, oh, woah, woah, oh
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, woah, oh, oh, woah, woah, oh "
2,Need You Now,Lady Antebellum," 
""Hey, sorry I missed your call, just leave a message after the beep""
""Hey, yeah, it's me, just been thinking about everything tonight
And I don't know, I just miss you so much
Give me a call back if you can?""

Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
Whoa, oh

I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

I just need you now
Oh baby, I need you now "
3,Hey Soul Sister,Train,"
Hey
Hey
Hey

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey

Hey

Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now, finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?

6,Airplanes,B.o.B," 
Can we pretend that
Airplanes in the night sky are like
Shooting stars? I could really use a
Wish right now, wish right now
Wish right now, can we pretend that
Airplanes in the night sky are like
Shooting stars? I could really use a
Wish right now, wish right now
Wish right now (Yeah)

I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin', but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravellin', they're sayin'
""What would you wish for if you had one chance?""
So airplane, airplane, sorry, I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Can we pretend that
Airplanes in the night sky are like
Shooting stars? (Shooting stars) I could really use a
Wish right now, wish right now
Wish right now, can we pretend that
Airplanes in the night sky are like
Shooting stars? (Shooting stars) I could really use a
Wish right now, wish right now
Wish right now (Yeah, yeah)

Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But, nowadays, we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Then maybe, oh, maybe I'll go back to the days (Days)
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listen to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So, can I get a wish to end the politics? (Oh)
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand, and then again, I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Can we pretend that
Airplanes in the night sky are like
Shooting stars? (Shooting stars) I could really use a
Wish right now, wish right now
Wish right now, can we pretend that
Airplanes in the night sky are like
Shooting stars? (Shooting stars) I could really use a
Wish right now, wish right now
Wish right now

I could really use a wish right now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
(Mm) Like, like
Like shooting stars (Ah)
I, I could
I could, I could really use a wish right now
A wish, a wish right now (A wish right now) "
7,Love the Way You Lie,Eminem," 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie "

She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own

And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain, you probably think that
This song is about you, don't you?

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your high brow, switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain, you probably think that
This song is about you, don't you?
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

Now don't you dare act like you don't know (don't know)
Know what's up (Know what's up) cause your nose is up
I'm approachin' up, pshht, yup
Like I can give you winter in the summer
Or summer in the winter, Miami in December
Tryna look bored in them Dior(Dior)
She probably is
Was actin' shallow 'til she found out how deep that my pockets is
Mrs. Primadonna, this is your reminder
That I think you fine, but I'm finer
Sean, yup
Cause it sure seems you got no doubts
But we all see you got your head in the clouds

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me "

Verse 1:
They overdosing on my swag
Put the whole god damn hood in rehab
Too many rumples in my duffle
Can't close this bag its so much cash
I need 10 hands now to count my stash
LL Cool Gucci Mane I'm back
Never need a mask best check my stash
You must be hall-u-cin-a-tin
1st day out girl ain't you glad?
6 supermodels crashing at my pad
I should be a model drinking outta gold bottles
With some tru religion jeans sagging off my ass
Please don't crash am I goin' to fast
Touchdown anywhere I don't need no pass
Might need some gum cause I'm finna talk trash
Cuz keep em on task like a kid at class
Hater can't hit what a hater can't see
Untouchable these haters sure can't see me
He wouldn't know a hit if you hit him in the head
With a 4 by 4 standing 6 foot 3
Ready for a bitch, crocodile dun sheet
Never met a girl I ain't fuck first week
You never seem a g throw a 10,000 white mink
On the floor live on B.E.T (Gucci)

I only got life I can live
There's only so much game I can give
So you could watch the show chillin' at your crib
And weeks turn to months, and months turn to years
But I be smoking dro, Ima fuck some hoes
Ima ball today, wake up, then go ball some more
Can't tell a grown man what to do with his
It's your prerogative Ima mind my biz
But Ima live the life, forever rocking ice
Throwing money popping bottles cause that's just what I like
(x2)
Verse 2:
Screaming I'mma be like the Black Eyed Peas
I wanna be free and you wanna be me
Best eased if you really want beef
Ima fight you by the trees looking like swiss cheese
Just came home ain't thinking bout sleep
Bitch ya favorite rapper ain't slept in weeks
Thinkin' bout me like I'm down the street
Know it's over soon as my feet touch concrete
Pull up in South Beach blowing on trees
Whipping down the street like I'm riding on D's
A new ferrari flying down Peachtree
Girl I might roll ya window down Gucci Mane please
Make sure 2010 I'm free,fall off in the booth like 1017
Before I'm through fire jumping out the roof but we dont need water please bring more weed
Niggas can't win now they wanna switch teams, can't entertain that by no means
You wanna get on nigga chase your dreams,stop chasing me down like a dope fiend
Starting off my day with an M-16, shit ain't been the same since I turned 16
My whole life changed, now it's so icy
1st album on the charts came out same week (Gucci)

Verse 3:
My auntie had a stroke and she still can't speak, wrote me every week real talk thats deep
Ex-cell mate gotta 35 piece, won't be released till 2033
It's my son's birthday my boy turned 3, and looking at him is like looking at me
Can't look back and watch the moves I make
But the moves that I made fuck around and move me
"
21,Empire State of Mind,Jay-Z ," 
Yeah

Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola, my Dominicanos (Dímelo!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say ""What up?"" to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out (Come on), I could trip a referee (Come on)
Tell by my attitude (Come on) that I'm most definitely from

In New York (Ayy, uh, yeah; aha)
Concrete jungle (Yeah) where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Yeah, okay)
Now you're in New York (Aha, aha, aha; uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (New)
Big lights will inspire you (Come on) (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (You welcome, OG; uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh, I made you hot, nigga)

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three-card Monte
Labor Day Parade—rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade (Come on, come on)
Long live the king, yo (Come on)—I'm from the Empire State, that's
In New York (Ayy; uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (That boy good, okay)
Now you're in New York (Uh, yeah, welcome to the bright lights, baby)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
Or they could step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse—don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA (Come on) got you feelin' like a champion (Come on)
The city never sleeps (Come on), better slip you a Ambien
In New York (Ayy, ow, uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)
Now you're in New York (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)
One hand in the air for the big city (Oh)
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty (Oh)
No place in the world that could compare (Nah)
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
""Yeah, yeah"" (Come on, come on)
""Yeah, yeah"" (Come on)

In New York (Uh, yeah, oh)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)

23,Billionaire,Travie McCoy," 
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here, lady, have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'ma have my own theme music

Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Let's go)

I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (So bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (Buy everything, ha-ha)
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (What up, Oprah? Ha-ha)
Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Sing it) when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad "
24,Not Afraid,Eminem," 
(I'm not afraid) Yeah
(To take a stand) It's been a ride
(Everybody) I guess I had to
(Come take my hand) Go to that place to get to this one
(We'll walk this road together, through the storm) Now some of you
(Whatever weather, cold or warm) Might still be in that place
(Just lettin' you know that you're not alone) If you're tryna get out
(Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road) Just follow me, I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings, instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me, you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I'd shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin', and
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road "

28,Your Love Is My Drug,Kesha," 
Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seein' it in my dreams
I'm lookin' down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm stayin' up all night hopin'
Hittin' my head against the wall

What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Momma's tellin' me I should think twice
But left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time (All the time)
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey, so I got a question (Yeah)
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement? (Yeah)
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum? (Yeah)
Is my love your drug? (Yeah)
Your drug (Yeah)
Huh, your drug (Yeah)
Huh, your drug (Yeah)
Is my love your drug? (Yeah)
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug (Ooh-woah)
Your love, your love, your love (Ooh-woah)
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug (Ooh-woah)
Your love, your love, your love (Ooh-woah)

Hey
Hey, so...
Your love, your love, your love, your love, is my drug
I like your beard "

You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams "

39,Haven't Met You Yet,Michael Buble,"
I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down

I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility

And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby, your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

And somehow, I know that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you, kid, I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

They say all’s fair in love and war
But I won’t need to fight it
We'll get it right and we'll be united

And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility

And someday, I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you, kid, I'll give more than I get
Than I get, than I get, than I get

Oh, you know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you, kid, to give so much more than I get, yeah

Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh-oh, oh-oh

And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""
You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Make it last)
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine (Hold on)

Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on)

Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top getting lonely (Young!)
Who think they test me now?
Run through your town, I shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from twenty-seven million (Young!)
And I want it all
It's gonna take more than that, hope that ain't all you got
I need it all (Hold up!)
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah

It's go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""Give me back my swag,"" they tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames
Louis belt, what that make me, Louis Mane?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be to 'em
Where them girls talking trash? Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at? Where them bloggers at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where your lighters at? Where your lighters at?

50,Young Forever,Jay-Z," 
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? (Uh)
Forever young (Young), I wanna be forever young (Forever young)
(Ayy, may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young
(But we ain't even thinkin' that far, ya know what I mean?)

So we living life like a video (Video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture-perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'til you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (Yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me, baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young
(Just let it run)
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches
Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (Hold up)
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous (Hold up)
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of Young

Forever young, I wanna be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young "

Between the noise you hear, and the sounds you like
Are we just sinking in an ocean of faces?

Only when it's over our heads
The sun is shining everyday, but it's far away
Over the world instead

Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me

There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free-for-all
When they—

When the dark of the night
Comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive
Lookin' for somethin' wild

And now we lookin' like pimps in my gold Trans Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey in my handbag
Got my drunk text on, I'll regret it in the mornin'
But tonight, I don't give a​—

When they take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know if you're lookin' for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off

Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious, tear it down
'Til the sun comes back around

N-now we gettin' so smashed, knockin' over trash cans
Errbody breakin' bottles, it's a filthy hot mess
And I'm down to get faded, I'm not the designated driver
So, I don't give a​—

Uh, uh
Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I'd done it, throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it, ahh

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?

I'm livin' life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

Uh, one thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin' I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?
Man, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over

Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah

Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

""She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on

So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But, baby, I think it's better if I let you know

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work, no (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye, oh-oh, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her, yeah (Say bye-bye)
Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on, it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, she give me déjà vu
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now (Oh!)

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her, oh-oh (Deuces)

70,Impossible,Shontelle," 
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now
When all is done, there is nothin' to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Fallin' out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Buildin' faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

And now
When all is gone, there is nothin' to say
And if you're done with embarrassin' me
On your own, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be

71,Forever,Drake ," 
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

Ayy, ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull they cameras out and, goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothin' to y'all

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, huh
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, woah
He can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouths with a bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so, Drake

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

72,Two Is Better Than One,Boys Like Girls," 
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought
""Hey, you know, this could be something""
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing

Then maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought, hey (Hey, hey)

Maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone

And I'm thinking, ooh, I can't live without you

But I'll figure out with all that's said and done

And twist and twist
Well, my first kiss went a little like this
And twist and twist

I said no more teachers and no more books

Lips like liquorice, tongue like candy
Excuse me miss, but can I get you out your panties?

In the back of the car, on the way to the bar
I got you on my lips (I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs with my fingers in your hair

You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, all that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down

It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there

85,Say Something,Timbaland," 
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you, we a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy, it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, huh?
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?

This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely

Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

Uh! I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but

Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in two's
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole

Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change

And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jessie James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me

Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments

91,The House That Built Me,Miranda Lambert," 
I know they say, ""You can’t go home again""
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could walk around, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me "
92,If I Die Young,The Band Perry," 
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls "
93,The Only Exception,Paramore," 
When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing "
94,American Honey,Lady Antebellum," 
She grew up on the side of the road
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows
She grew up good, she grew up slow
Like American honey

Steady as a preacher, free as a weed
Couldn't wait to get goin', but wasn't quite ready to leave
So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey

There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Get caught in the race of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
To American honey, yeah

There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Gone for so long now
I gotta get back to her somehow
To American honey
Mm, yeah, yeah

Ooh, there's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Keep drinkin' coffee, stare me down across the table
While I look outside
So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by
You've got opinions, man, we're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked
So, let me thank you for your time
And try to not waste any more of mine
Get outta here fast

I hate to break it to you, babe
But I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
Oh

You sound so innocent, all full of good intent
Swear you know best
But you expect me to jump up on board with you
And ride off into your delusional sunset
I'm not the one who's lost with no direction, oh
But you'll never see
You're so busy makin' maps with my name on them in all caps
You got the talkin' down, just not the listening

And who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

All my life I've tried (Tried)
To make everybody happy while I
Just hurt (Hurt) and hide
Waiting for someone to tell me it's my turn to decide
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
Oh, who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

96,Life After You,Daughtry," 
Ten miles from town and I just broke down
Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone, just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong, but you already know

Believe me, I won't stop at nothin'
To see you, so I've started runnin'

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

Last time we talked, the night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back of my mind
I must've been high to say you and I
Weren't meant to be and just wasting my time

Oh, why did I ever doubt you?
You know I would die here without you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

You and I, right or wrong, there's no other one
After this time I spent alone
It's hard to believe that a man with sight could be so blind
Thinkin' 'bout the better times, must've been outta my mind
So I'm runnin' back to tell you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you, God knows what I'd do, yeah

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through, yeah
Know there's no life after you

Know there's no life after you (Know there's no life after you)
Know there's no life after you (Know there's no life after you)
Know there's no life after you (Know there's no life after you)
Know there's no life after you, yeah "
97,Smile,Uncle Kracker," 
You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler than the flip-side of my pillow,  that's right
Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me
It lets me know that it's okay (Yeah, it's okay)
And the moments when my good times start to fade

You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that

You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Don't know how I live without you
Cause every time that I get around you
I see the best of me inside your eyes
You make me smile

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile
You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile "

Let's do it, do it

Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

And all the time, you were tellin' me lies, hey

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, only nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me?
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me
Looking in the sky, I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
With you
Right 'til the end
Oh

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's 'bout to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
I'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Without my love
